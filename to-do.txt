To-Do

1. ILP-Based Row Placer
Inputs: Primitive cells: GDS files, netlists
        JSON files (connectivity, primitives, placement constraints)
Task:
        Develop an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)â€“based row placement algorithm to:
        Place primitives within predefined rows 
        Generate placed layout GDS files
        Optimize area utilization
        Minimize total wire length


2. Once the placer code is done we go for the routing code
Tasks:
        Coordinate with Ramprasath on the router
        Use Hanan router
